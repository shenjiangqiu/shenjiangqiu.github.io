# OS Project4

## add a systemcall

the c code interface: user.h, user program will include this header to link.

the c code file to which the user program will link: usys.S:
```
#define SYSCALL(name) \
  .globl name; \
  name: \
    movl $SYS_ ## name, %eax; \
    int $T_SYSCALL; \
    ret

```
this code will generate the implementation for user level fork... like 
```

fork(){
    movl $SYS_fork
    int T_SYSCALL;
    ret
}
```

when use ```int SYS_fork```, it will go to the trap(),if it find it's a T_SYSCALL, it will call syscall() in syscall.c, and read the call number. and will execute:syscall[num](), where syscall is a array to functions, the num is defined in syscall.h, and the function is defined in like sysproc.c or other place, for real call.

So, inorder to inplement a system call, we need to next several steps:for example fork

1. add user.h fork() defination.
2. in usys.S, add the name tag and map to SYS_fork number.
3. in syscall.h, add the number. that is define the sys_fork number
4. in syscall.c map the number in to the real function. in the syscalls array, add the map. SYS_fork number to sys_fork function. add extern link above.
5. in another file, like sysproc.c, implement the sys_fork function. if this function have args, add another kernel funcion fork() to take args and execute and sys_fork only extract the args and call fork() in proc.c
