# fix bugs in new_gcn and cause other bugs and fix it...

## fix bug in the new_gcn memory interface which will cause error in map::out of range

1. add debug information, and find an error in memory interface where the addr to request map add twice and return twice for the same addr.
2. later, figure out that the same addr may exist when two request droped in the same cache line
3. add a buffer mechanism: where change to map to addr to a vector of reqs, now can merge the request with the same addr

## fix bug in dead lock after fixing ther previouse bug

1. the bug is happend when I try to run test case, and then dead lock happend.
2. add a debug tool: a RAII object to control the debug level
3. using the debug tool to find out that, when dead lock happend, the addr_to_req is not empty, means it's still waiting the requst return from the memory
4. after adding some logs, find out that all request is already in the map...finnaly find the bug in the previuse if statement.

## test the model

- the bandwidht is not expected hight as I thought.
