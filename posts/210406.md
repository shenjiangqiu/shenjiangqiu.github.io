# add support for multiple channel send in GCN and implement memory stats and Realcpu in Minisat

## add support for multiple channel

1. add support for Mac(remove some asm code)
2. update ramulator and dramsim to use new catch and fmt version
3. fix a bug in HBM and Dramsim3, there head file have so many same definitions, need to be carefull about the names.
4. modify the HBM ramulator and Dramsim3 source code to support get channels and get channel id
5. modify the wrappers, add several send queues.

## add support for memory stats and real cpu for minisat

1. for memory stats, add output in ramulator wrapper.
2. for realcpu time. add output and control logic in Solver::solve
3. refactor the run script to better support the real time simulation.
