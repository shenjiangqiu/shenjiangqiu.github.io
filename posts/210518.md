# Analysis result

## problem: dense and cont seems exactly the same??

### try1: run mannuly for one benchmark

1. choose a quick bench:acm_graph_data
2. run by create run_test.py
3. read the result, find the cycle is still the same

### try2: change the code, output the configureation

1. is the -enable-dense work??
2. build the run.sh to run two exp simutanously
3. find the problem! the option is not successfully set, both dense is false!!

## debug the code to solve the problem

1. read the code to find the reason:failed to find the reason
2. read the BoolOption class to read the parse code. find the code is correct
3. read the run script again, find the reason: use _ instead of the -, the variable name is _ but the parse string is -!

## test the test

result: pass

## fix the original run script

result: pass

## re-run the experiments

* the cont result is valid, only need to run the dense version,set the cores to be 10(original : 4)
* the result seems good
* modifiy the get.py to get the traffic infomation
  * seems good

## analysis the data

### total_idle_waiting_out is extreamly large!! find that he code in systolic Array is wrong, fix the bug!
