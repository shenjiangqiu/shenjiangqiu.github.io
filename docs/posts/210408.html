      <h1>fix bugs in new_gcn and cause other bugs and fix it...</h1>
<h2>fix bug in the new_gcn memory interface which will cause error in map::out of range</h2>
<ol>
<li>add debug information, and find an error in memory interface where the addr to request map add twice and return twice for the same addr.</li>
<li>later, figure out that the same addr may exist when two request droped in the same cache line</li>
<li>add a buffer mechanism: where change to map to addr to a vector of reqs, now can merge the request with the same addr</li>
</ol>
<h2>fix bug in dead lock after fixing ther previouse bug</h2>
<ol>
<li>the bug is happend when I try to run test case, and then dead lock happend.</li>
<li>add a debug tool: a RAII object to control the debug level</li>
<li>using the debug tool to find out that, when dead lock happend, the addr_to_req is not empty, means it's still waiting the requst return from the memory</li>
<li>after adding some logs, find out that all request is already in the map...finnaly find the bug in the previuse if statement.</li>
</ol>
<h2>test the model</h2>
<ul>
