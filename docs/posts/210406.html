      <h1>add support for multiple channel send in GCN and implement memory stats and Realcpu in Minisat</h1>
<h2>add support for multiple channel</h2>
<ol>
<li>add support for Mac(remove some asm code)</li>
<li>update ramulator and dramsim to use new catch and fmt version</li>
<li>fix a bug in HBM and Dramsim3, there head file have so many same definitions, need to be carefull about the names.</li>
<li>modify the HBM ramulator and Dramsim3 source code to support get channels and get channel id</li>
<li>modify the wrappers, add several send queues.</li>
</ol>
<h2>add support for memory stats and real cpu for minisat</h2>
<ol>
<li>for memory stats, add output in ramulator wrapper.</li>
<li>for realcpu time. add output and control logic in Solver::solve</li>
<li>refactor the run script to better support the real time simulation.</li>
</ol>
